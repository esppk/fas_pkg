This is detailed tutorial demo of how the functions in the package are used in real applications.

This fas package provide basic functionalities to read, extract and plot data.
In this vignette, we use a actual example to demonstrate the application.


##example
Using fas package, we can summarize the traffic amount for each month of given years. Following is a example of doing so.

```{r}
#summarize data for the 2013,2014
library(Fas)
years <- list(2013,2014)
fars_summarize_years(years)
```

In next example, we will extract traffic data in 2014 for state number 24, and plot those data in
in map.
```{r, message=F}
library(maps)
fars_map_state(24, 2014)
```
